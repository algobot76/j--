# Overview

This repository contains the updated j-- base compiler for the textbook,
<a href="https://www.cs.umb.edu/j--/">Introduction to Compiler Construction in a Java World</a>
by Bill Campbell, Swami Iyer, and Bahar Akbal-Deliba&#351;, which is a non-trivial 
subset of the Java&trade; programming language. The compiler is organized in 
an object-oriented style. Although most compilers are not written this way, we
decided to organize it this way because you will most likely be programming in
an object-oriented style.
